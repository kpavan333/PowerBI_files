# Blinkit Sales Performance Analysis

This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution, using various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and visualizations created in Power BI. The objective is to identify key insights and opportunities for optimization, aiding data-driven decision-making for Blinkit operations.

## Business Requirements

The goal of this project is to analyze the following key aspects:

- **Sales Performance**: Understanding the overall sales data, trends, and patterns.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Analyzing average ratings and customer feedback to determine satisfaction levels.
- **Inventory Distribution**: Assessing how inventory is distributed across different outlet types, locations, and characteristics.

## KPIs to be Analyzed

The following KPIs are critical for evaluating Blinkit's performance:

1. **Total Sales**: The overall revenue generated from all items sold across outlets.
2. **Average Sales**: The average revenue per sale transaction.
3. **Number of Items**: The total count of distinct items sold.
4. **Average Rating**: The average customer rating for all items sold.

## Visualizations and Charts

### 1. **Total Sales by Fat Content**
   - **Objective**: Analyze the impact of fat content on total sales and customer purchasing behavior.
   - **Additional KPIs**: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, and Average Rating) vary with fat content.
   - **Chart Type**: Donut chart to show the proportion of total sales by fat content categories.
   
### 2. **Total Sales by Item Type**
   - **Objective**: Identify the performance of different item types in terms of total sales.
   - **Additional KPIs**: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, and Average Rating) vary by item type.
   - **Chart Type**: Bar chart to compare total sales across item types.

### 3. **Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales**
   - **Objective**: Analyze the performance of different items (categorized by fat content) in terms of total sales across various outlets.
   - **Additional KPIs**: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, and Average Rating) vary with fat content across outlets.
   - **Chart Type**: Bar chart for comparing fat content sales across outlets.

### 4. **Total Sales by Outlet Establishment**
   - **Objective**: Evaluate how the age or type of outlet establishment influences total sales.
   - **Chart Type**: Line chart to visualize trends over time and differences between various outlet types or ages.

### 5. **Sales by Outlet Size**
   - **Objective**: Analyze the correlation between outlet size and total sales, identifying whether larger or smaller outlets perform better.
   - **Chart Type**: Donut or pie chart to represent the share of sales based on outlet size.

### 6. **Sales by Outlet Location**
   - **Objective**: Assess the geographic distribution of sales across different outlet locations, identifying regional performance differences.
   - **Chart Type**: Funnel Map to provide a visual representation of sales distribution across different locations.

### 7. **All Metrics by Outlet Type**
   - **Objective**: Provide a comprehensive view of all key metrics (Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, and Average Rating) broken down by outlet type.
   - **Chart Type**: Matrix card to display all KPIs in a consolidated manner for each outlet type.

## Power BI Implementation

Power BI was used to create interactive visualizations for the analysis. The provided charts give an intuitive view of various aspects of Blinkit’s sales and customer behavior, making it easier to spot trends and areas for improvement.

The dataset includes the following fields:
- Sales data (total and per item)
- Customer ratings
- Item characteristics (fat content, item type, etc.)
- Outlet characteristics (size, location, establishment type)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Power BI Desktop**: The report is created using Power BI Desktop. Ensure you have it installed to view and modify the reports.
- **Data Source**: The data used in the analysis should include sales transactions, customer feedback, and outlet characteristics.
- **Power BI Skills**: Basic knowledge of Power BI is helpful for navigating the reports and making any modifications or updates to the dataset.

### Example of KPIs and Visualization

Once the dataset is loaded, you can interact with the visualizations, filtering and slicing data by various parameters such as outlet type, location, fat content, and item type.

### Customization

If you wish to customize or extend this report:
- Add new metrics or KPIs.
- Modify existing visualizations or chart types.
- Connect additional data sources if needed for further analysis.

## Conclusion

This report provides a holistic view of Blinkit’s sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. By visualizing the data through various KPIs and charts, stakeholders can identify key trends and opportunities to optimize sales, improve customer satisfaction, and streamline inventory management across all outlets.
